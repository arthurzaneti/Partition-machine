# Finding-the-666th-partition-number
Trying to find the number of partitions of the number 666. For a better explanation on what is a partition look at this wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)

This challenge was proposed in the video "The hardest "What comes next?" (Euler's pentagonal formula)" from the youtube channel Mathologer. Link for the entire video:

As I finished the challenged proposed by Mathologer I decided to make a program that could find any partition number, not just the 667th (one more than 666 because of partitions for 0). The finished project finds the number of partitions for ANY value.
